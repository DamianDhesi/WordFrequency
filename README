Line 153 in main.c is which is the error message for when a file/dir does not
exist is commented out. When running ~pn-cs357/demos/fw the demo fw prints out
the error message but the missing file cases for ~pn-cs357/demos/tryAsgn2 do 
not. Hence I am confused on what the output should be so the line can be 
uncommented if the missing file cases for ~pn-cs357/demos/tryAsgn2 are 
incorrect. Discrepency between demos/fw and demos/tryAsgn2 as of 4/15.

No further grading info.
